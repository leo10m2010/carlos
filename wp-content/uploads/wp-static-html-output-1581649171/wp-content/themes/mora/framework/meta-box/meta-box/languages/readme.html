<h2 id="who-translates-meta-box-how-can-i-get-involved-">Who translates Meta Box? How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>Anyone can help by suggesting new translations <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/meta-box">here</a>. No need to use a translation editor, you can do it all from the web interface.</p>
<p>Once you've suggested a new translation, a language validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next Meta Box release.</p>
<h2 id="who-decides-which-languages-are-available-i-want-my-language-added">Who decides which languages are available? I want my language added</h2>
<p>If you can't find your language, <a href="https://metabox.io">send us an email</a> and we'll add it for you.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-change-translations-locally-where-can-i-download-the-po-file-for-my-language-">I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language?</h2>
<p>You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page.</p>
